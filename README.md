## Compilation and running code

Code was all written in Java.  Environments used were Visual Studio and Atom.  The code includes a make file, and can be compiled and run by using

```make run```

Values in the database are stored in the storage folder in CSV files, and can be edited manually.  However, if formatted improperly this will cause undefined behavior.
